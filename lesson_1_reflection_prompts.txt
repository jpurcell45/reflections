How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Side by side comparison are relatively quick and easy to perform.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It makes it easy to go back and see exactly what changes were made each step of the way.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    By choosing to commit when it makes logical sense vs at some random point all the
    changes will be in that one commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is typically used for web pages which have multiple linked files vs Google
    docs probably is a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use those tools to see differences from one commit to the next.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know I can always revert back to a known working version of code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Track my commits.
